<div class="faq-container">
    <div class="faq-card">
        <h2>Where do you ship from?</h2>
        <p>We dispatch from our Australian regional hub, so domestic orders are fulfilled locally for fast, reliable delivery.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-card">
        <h2>How long does delivery take?</h2>
        <p>Most domestic deliveries arrive within 1–4 business days after dispatch. International timelines vary by destination and carrier route, typically 5–10 business days, with remote regions taking longer.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-card">
        <h2>Will I receive a tracking number?</h2>
        <p>Yes. Infinite Labs tracks every shipment digitally and manually. If your order has not arrived within 72 hours of payment, please contact support.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-card">
        <h2>Where do you ship to?</h2>
        <p>We ship to most countries where research compound imports are permitted. Please verify local regulations before ordering. We may decline shipments if compliance risks are identified.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-card">
        <h2>What if my order does not arrive?</h2>
        <p>If tracking shows no movement for an extended period or the carrier confirms loss, contact us. After verification, we will arrange a complimentary reship or another resolution under our delivery assurance policy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-card">
        <h2>Do I get a refund if my order does not arrive?</h2>
        <p>Verified non-delivery is typically resolved with a free reship first. Refunds may be issued at our discretion if a reship is not viable. Claims must be submitted within 30 days of the original shipping date.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-card">
        <h2>Are packages sent securely and discreetly?</h2>
        <p>Absolutely. Shipments use non-descriptive packaging with no external branding. Protective internal packaging helps maintain product integrity in transit.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-card">
        <h2>Does your shipping method protect peptides?</h2>
        <p>Yes. Temperature-sensitive items are stored under controlled conditions before dispatch, and packaging is selected to reduce heat and moisture exposure during transit.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-card">
        <h2>What payment methods do you accept?</h2>
        <p>We accept major credit and debit cards, select digital payment options, and approved alternative settlement methods depending on region. Available methods are shown at checkout.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-card">
        <h2>Do you offer refunds?</h2>
        <p>Refunds are considered for defective, damaged-on-arrival, or non-delivered items after verification. Due to the nature of research compounds, opened or used products cannot be returned.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-card">
        <h2>Can I cancel my order?</h2>
        <p>Orders may be cancelled before fulfillment. Once a tracking number is issued or the parcel enters carrier custody, cancellations are no longer possible. Contact support immediately for changes.</p>
