# Quick Start - Auto-Sync Setup

## Simple Solution: Use the Batch File

Instead of relying on VS Code's automatic tasks, just double-click this file to start working:

**📂 start-vscode-with-autosync.bat**

This will:
1. ✅ Start auto-sync in the background (hidden window)
2. ✅ Open VS Code automatically
3. ✅ Everything is synced automatically every 30 seconds

## Optional: Add to Windows Startup

To make it start automatically when Windows boots:

1. Press `Win + R` and type: `shell:startup`
2. Create a shortcut to `start-vscode-with-autosync.bat` in that folder
3. Restart your computer

Now it will always be running when you turn on your computer.

## That's It!

No more troubleshooting VS Code settings. Just use the batch file. 🚀
